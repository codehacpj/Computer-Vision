### This repository contains tutorials and projects on following topics:
1. Face Detection: Uses OpenCV to deploy Haar Cascades to detect face, eyes and smile from the web cam feed.
2. Object Detection: Uses Pytorch to deploy SSD(Single Shot detection) algorithm to detect objects using VOC (Visual Object detection) dataset.
3. Image generation using GANs: pytorch and torchvision libraries were used to
deploy GANs to generate images using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets for training.
